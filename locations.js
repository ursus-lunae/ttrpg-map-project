Far north, next to the vast, remote swampland that is the Fingerbog, this small community is slowly growing and claiming the surrounding territories. This land is hostile and unforgiving, and Nature is a harsh enemy, but all dangers pale in comparison to the settlers’ dream: freedom from the scuffles of old, independence, and a new home that hopefully lacks the faults of each settler’s past dwellings.",
